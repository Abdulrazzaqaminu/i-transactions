                    Without even looking into this from the angle of progrmming.
                    Disableed people in general are in an automatic disadvantage at living in general, but it does not have to be always like that.
                    What we plan to do in our website is to do our part in helping visually impaired people on having an equal ground whenn it comes to 
                    financial transactions with their respective banks, because they also need money to survive, but they cannot do that is the website or application
                    does not consider them.

                       We provide text to speech, so as to help the users know what to do when they first enter the website.
                       We also provide keyboard functionality. Visually impaired people have a special type of keyboard which uses braille, braille allows blind people to feel the pattern of a letter which allows them to type.
                       This is also a form of written language for blind people.

                       This website was created due to a project given from another course (System analysis).
                       So i used this front-end project as a stepping stone for the other project, so this website compliments the other. This just advertises the other website.
                       And that is the origin of I Transaction.
